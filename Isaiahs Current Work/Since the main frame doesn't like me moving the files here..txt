Since the GUI mainframe doesn't like the stuff Isaiah sent and allowed for me to thread through to the mainframe, here's a list of that which Isaiah worked on.


1. Variables.py
2. Revised / edited the Background_shuffler.py
3. the presets menu (The one threaded to the mainframe)
4. gif presets (frame by frame)
